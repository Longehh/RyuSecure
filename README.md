# RyuSecure
## Dependencies
- Spigot

## Description
This is a plugin which forces all staff members with the permission specified in the config.yml to /register, and then /login. This also removes any logs of /login,
and /register from console logs, as well as IP Addresses of players when they join the server.

Why choose this over StaffSecure?
- RyuSecure uses Argon2 to hash all data i.e. Passwords, and IP Addresses whereas Staff Secure uses MD5 which someone can easily crack if the system was breached.
